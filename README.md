# Introduction
This cybersecurity Papers Database Tool is a project developed by [ThreatIntelligenceLab.com](https://threatintelligencelab.com), designed to automatically collect and store academic and technical papers related to cybersecurity. The tool is intended for educational and research purposes, providing a valuable resource for anyone interested in the field of cybersecurity.

# Features
- Automated Paper Downloading: Automatically downloads papers based on specified search queries.
- Database Management: Stores papers in a SQLite database, including metadata like URLs, dates, MD5 checksums, and domains.
- Search Functionality: Includes functionality to search through the stored papers in the database using keywords.
- Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface that allows users to interact with the tool, submit search queries, and download papers.
# How It Works
- The tool performs automated searches to find and download papers, which are then stored in a database along with relevant metadata. Users can interact with the system through a web interface to download new papers, search the existing database, or view statistics about the downloads.

# How it started
I wanted to have a local system that will collect papers. I got a little bit carried away. So I ended up building a PoC interface for a system that collects papers for me from the web. It currently only uses Google. There is no installation guide. You most likely will be prompted by Python to install some required dependencies. It all speaks for itself. 

#  Why share this ? 
Because I believe anyone can adjust the code and make something cool with it. Also I believe that if you are a student, or just very involved in cybersecurity, that this project might be a nice asset to have. Anyhow. Enjoy and please do share or mention ThreatIntelligenceLab.com if you liked this project.
